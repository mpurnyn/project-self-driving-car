# Final Project

1. Install Modified Carla from Course
2. Get the starting code and put in the python client folder.
3. Edit the controller 2.py class file
   1. follow the waypoints
   2. The "controller2d.py" file contains a controller object. 
      1. You will implement the controller in the update_controls method labeled by the comment blocks 
         1. (find all comment blocks that contain "MODULE 7" - these serves as anchor points for you to implement your code below them).
   3. All units are in SI (meters, seconds, radians)
   4. left-handed coordinate system
   5. waypoints - list of waypoints. waypoint - [x, y, velocity]
   6. waypoints update every step
   7. subset of entire set of waypoints
