# Challenges for the Industry
- how do we deliver for millions of customers
- how do we deal with larger maps
- how do we deal with different geometry
- how do we say strong things about such complex systems?
  - formally verify the code?
    - difficult to scale, and calculating all potential inputs is hard. still useful for most important components.
  - Simulate it?
    - simulators are not that good and cant simulate very detailed sensors as well. still useful.
  - Drive Drive Drive?
    - record millions of miles and playback interesting failures in simulated testing.
  - All are useful methods and should be used in tandem
