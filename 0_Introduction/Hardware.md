# Hardware


## Choosing Hardware
Chosing hardware should be based on the ODD of the problem.
- also budget constraints and redundancy.

In the case of driving we can break down the problem into 4 common scenarios.
Urban Driving, Highway Driving, Intersections, and Roundabouts.

Sensor Coverage should have longitudinal and lateral coverege and cover all relavant parts of the scenario.
- and take into account costs and blindspots

You can determine this by using Sensor Coverage Analysis - or drawing out the scenarios to determin directions you need to sense and the distances you need sense them at.
